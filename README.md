# 🚀 Trello API Automation Testing Project

## 📖 Project Overview
The Trello API Automation Testing Project is designed to validate Trello's API functionalities using **RestAssured and TestNG**. This project automates key API operations, including **board management, list management, and card handling**, ensuring reliability, efficiency, and robustness in API responses.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary objectives of this automation framework are to:
- ✅ **Ensure API reliability and functional correctness** by validating CRUD operations.
- ✅ **Enhance test coverage** across different scenarios, including edge cases and negative testing.
- ✅ **Optimize testing efforts** by reducing manual intervention and executing automated API tests efficiently.
- ✅ **Improve reporting and debugging** through **Allure Reports**, providing insightful execution logs and visualized test results.
- ✅ **Implement best practices** for maintainable and scalable API test automation.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
This project is built using the following technologies and tools:

| Technology/Tool         | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| **Java**              | Core programming language for automation scripts |
| **RestAssured**       | API testing framework for validating HTTP requests and responses |
| **TestNG**            | Test framework for managing test execution and reporting |
| **Allure Reports**    | Generates detailed test execution reports with logs and attachments |
| **Maven**             | Manages dependencies and builds the project efficiently |
| **JSON Assertions**   | Validates expected vs actual API responses |
